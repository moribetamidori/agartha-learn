## 📝 Your IKIGAI 
Here's an example of what we wrote in as our Ikigai when we created Agartha  

![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/22/PcNv5ThDuIXOoeY.png)

### ✨ What's Your Ikigai? 
```javascript react-live=true
"1. What do you love to do?"
```
```javascript react-live=true
"2. What are you good at?"
```
```javascript react-live=true
"3. What can you be paid for?"
```
```javascript react-live=true
"4. What the world needs?"
```

## 😇  Reach You Higher Self 

👱‍♀️**Person A**

Meditate the following questions for 1 mins. 

"Close your eyes and feel into your struggle. Try to stay with the core feeling you are struggling with inside. Can you feel an unmet need underneath? Maybe a need for significance, love or certainty? Is there anything the other person could do to help address your need? Try to imagine a concrete request you could make. Now try to have compassion for your struggle: "May I be able to let go of my anger, fears and worries? May I find a deeper peace of mind?”

```javascript react-live=true
"What I'm currently struggling with....."
```

👩‍⚖️**Person B**
After Person A finishes, Person B can share impact and ask A's higher self: 

```javascript react-live=true
"What would *you* do hearing Person A's issue? How do you feel about the situation? Is there anything else you want to tell person A? What's your purpose in life? "
```
👱‍♀️**Person A**
Then... imagine there's a chair that represents you, and you are standing behind the chair that represents your higher self... and answer Person B's question.
