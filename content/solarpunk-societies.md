# Building the Future We Want to See.
This is an open source course syllabus on building Solarpunk Societies. Solarpunk envisions a sustainable society enabled by cutting-edge technologies, interconnected with nature and community. 
 
"Solar" represents renewable energy such as solar power, while "punk" refers to the countercultural, post-capitalist, and decolonial communitarian ethos for creating such a future.
 
In short, Solarpunk can be summarized as: Using advanced technology in service to mankindsâ€™ overall wellbeing.
 
Both â€˜technologyâ€™ and â€˜wellbeingâ€™ are multi-dimensional concepts beyond just infrastructure and physical health. This course dives into details on what these technologies can be, and what a holistically improved human society looks like.
