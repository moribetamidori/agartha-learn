>*The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things "because we're supposed to" - Marshall Rosenberg*  

## 📝 What's your deepest fear?
```javascript react-live=true
"Use following prompt to write your answer: I'm afraid of.... because...[any motivation/reason you can think of].(e.g. I'm afraid that if I quit my bullshit job because I think I will ended up even more miserable because I couldn't sustain myself.) "
```

## 🧤 What are the Needs behind our Fears? 
Rosenberg listed 6 motivations that preventing us to take action to change the course of our life. None of them are our **actual needs** but **strategies** to satisfy our needs. I will use quitting job as an example to explain the following motivations. 
### 💰 For Money
The statement of "I can't quit my job because I have to pay my rent" can always be translated to "I choose to use my current job as a mean to support myself financially". When you think that way, doors start to open. Maybe I could moved out from my expensive apartment and moved in with family, and start a part-time job in the transition period. Maybe I could try to do some hustles, meeting new friends in the communities to figure out what I really want to do with my life etc. 
### ✅ For Approval
Traditional Schools and societies have trained us to be a "good person". We always do things that make other people like us but ended up ignoring our own very happiness - "If I gave up this fancy job title, everyone else would think me as looser." Cognitive dissonance always occurs when we other people admiring the job we hate doing. There's a big emotional difference between this and when people actually appreciating the works we love doing. 
### 🏃 To Escape Punishment 
Maybe you're on H1B and you may be forced to leave the country after period ends, maybe you signed some agreement upfront where leaving the company will cost you a lot of money, you name it, that restrained us from taking the action that could potentially make us happy in the future.  
### 😕 To Avoid Shame
Before you got some disappointing stares from your parents or loved ones, you might already start to questioning yourself about your own decision. Why can't I just have a normal job just like everyone else? What's wrong with myself? 
### 🥲 To Avoid Guilt
Before you got some disappointing stares from your parents or loved ones, you might already start to questioning yourself about your own decision. Why can't I just have a normal job just like everyone else? What's wrong with myself? 
### 💼 To Satisfy a Sense of Duty
Often times we do things so that other people won't be disappointed to us. A miserable world always starts with us doing things for other people and ignoring our own inner voice and very needs. 

## 📝 You turn! What's your need behind your fears?

```javascript react-live=true
"Trying to translate 'Have to' to 'Choose to'. What do you do in your life that you don't experience as playful? List any activity you dread but do anyway because you perceive yourself to have no choice. And try to use the following prompt: I choose to do .... because I want...[your needs]"
```

## 📝 After realizing your needs, what other options can you choose to satisify your needs? 

```javascript react-live=true
"I realize that I could choose to... to satisify my needs of..."
```
