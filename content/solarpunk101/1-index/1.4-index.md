## 🕹️ Game of Change

**Person A** tells a true story about their life with emotional charge for them, then at any point, **Person B** can say, **Change!** and A has to change to what they would have liked to have happened, or what they would have wanted the situation to be. 

👱‍♀️**Person A**
```javascript react-live=true
"After I quit my job, I was excited for a while and then started to feel a little bit depressed because I have no other income to support myself, and..."
```

👩‍⚖️**Person B**
```javascript react-live=true
"Change!"
```

👱‍♀️**Person A**
```javascript react-live=true
"Actually, it was the best decision I have ever made, I have made so much friends afterwards and experienced so many communities and finally found out what I'm passionate about and able to support myself doing the stuff I loved to do."
```
